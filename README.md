# Solutions to Advent of Code 2017
This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) puzzles.
The solutions are written in TypeScript and can be run using Node.js.

## Building the code
To build the code, run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Running a solution
To run a solution, run the following command:
```
node dist/day1.js
```
where `1` should be replaced by the number of the puzzle.
